My co-worker, Chris, [twitter.com/ckalima](https://twitter.com/ckalima), and I hacked up a little project hours before Coachella 2012 Weekend 1 started: [coachellagram.com](http://coachellagram.com) . It displays, in real-time, a feed of Instagram photos taken at Coachella.

It was a great experience learning about pubsub technology, pushing data to browsers, and working with the Instagram API. Instagram has a very rich API and I'm excited to see what people are going to with it in the future.

Stay tuned for Weekend 2! at [coachellagram.com](http://coachellagram.com)

**UPDATE**: Coachellagram has been brought down. Sorry if you missed out. We did get some exposure at TNW: [
